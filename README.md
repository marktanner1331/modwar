# Mod War

A heavily unfinished command & Conquer style game written in c#.

The entire game exists to be modded, with no default behaviour. Everything is a mod, and users can write their own mods and extend functionality. 

To accomplish this, dependency injection is used, with dependencies scanned and loaded at runtime from DLL's.
